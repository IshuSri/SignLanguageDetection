# SignLanguageDetectionandRe-Evaluation

Title: Sign Language Detection and Re-Evaluation Project

Summary:

This project aims to detect and interpret sign language gestures using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system employs the MediaPipe library for hand tracking and landmark detection, enabling accurate recognition of hand gestures. OpenCV is utilized for image processing, capturing video frames, and displaying real-time results. The project involves training a custom LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to recognize sign language gestures based on extracted hand keypoints.

Key Features:

Hand tracking and landmark detection using MediaPipe for accurate gesture analysis.
Utilization of OpenCV for real-time video processing, frame capture, and display.
Custom LSTM neural network trained on a dataset of hand gesture sequences.
Training process involves capturing and processing hand images, extracting keypoints, and building a robust model.
Sign language gestures are visually represented and interpreted in real-time.
Dependencies:

MediaPipe: for hand tracking and landmark detection.
OpenCV: for computer vision tasks and real-time video processing.
NumPy: for numerical operations and array manipulation.
Keras: for building and training the LSTM neural network.
TensorBoard: for monitoring and visualizing the training process.
This project serves as a foundation for creating sign language interpretation applications and can be expanded for broader applications in gesture recognition. Users can contribute by adding more sign language gestures to enhance the model's vocabulary and improve overall accuracy.
